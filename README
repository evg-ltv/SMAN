Oracle Source Manager
Current version - 1.0.12 (24 Jan 2012)

A small and simple application which helps manage Oracle source code.
Key features:
	- saves source code in files
	- generates deployment scripts
	- has flexible configuration

Client - console application written in C#
Server - configuration tables and PL/SQL package

For the most part, server uses dbms_metadata to obtain source code.
When there was a bug or unsuitable behavior, I preferred generating code by myself (e.g. views and sequences).

Source Manager is being used successfully with Oracle 10g, 11g.
